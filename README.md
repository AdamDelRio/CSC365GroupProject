## Proposal
Our proposal is to create a custom pc builder website.  Users will be able to pick parts and check the compatibility between the parts to ensure they can all work together.  Prices of all of the parts will be shown to estimate the cost of the pc, as well as an estimation for shipping charges. We will keep track of stock, and restock items when necessary. Additionally, users will be able to trade and sell their own pc parts.
